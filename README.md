Titanic Survival Prediction Project

🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The Titanic dataset, available on Kaggle, is a well-known dataset that contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic. The objective is to build a model that accurately predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, sex, passenger class, and other relevant details.

📊 Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset consists of the following key features:

Feature	Description
PassengerId	Unique passenger identifier
Pclass	Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name	Passenger name
Sex	Gender of the passenger
Age	Age of the passenger (in years)
SibSp	Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch	Number of parents/children aboard
Ticket	Ticket number
Fare	Fare paid for the ticket
Cabin	Cabin number
Embarked	Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Survived	Survival status (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)
🔍 Project Workflow
1⃣ Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values (especially for Age, Cabin, and Embarked)

Encode categorical variables (Sex, Embarked)

Normalize and scale numerical features (Age, Fare)

2⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze survival rates across different features

Visualize data distributions and correlations

3⃣ Feature Selection
Select key features based on correlation and domain knowledge

Drop irrelevant or highly correlated features

4⃣ Model Selection & Training
Test various machine learning models, including:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

5⃣ Model Evaluation
Evaluate models using:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

Select the best-performing model for final prediction

6⃣ Prediction & Deployment
Generate survival predictions for test data

Deploy the model (Optional)
